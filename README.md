# BeniaminoSquitieri

## 👋 Hi, I'm Beniamino Squitieri

🤖 Robotics Engineer working on **autonomous robotic systems**, with a strong focus on **control**, **navigation**, and **embodied intelligence**.

🚀 I design and deploy robots that must operate in **real environments**, where perception is incomplete, contact is unavoidable, and robustness matters more than clean demos.

## 🏢 Current Position

🎓 **Research Fellow at Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)**
🤖 Working on the **R1 humanoid robot**, contributing to autonomy pipelines that span perception, planning, and control, with experimental validation on physical hardware.

My work involves **system-level integration** and real-world testing, rather than isolated algorithmic components.

## 🧠 Research Interests

My research interests sit at the intersection of **Vision-Language-Action models**, **tactile sensing**, and **adaptive control for contact-rich manipulation**.

### Core Research Direction

* **Adaptive robotic manipulation in unstructured environments**
  Learning how robots can remain reliable when contact dynamics, friction, and object poses deviate from demonstrations.

* **Vision-Language-Action models beyond open-loop execution**
  Studying how foundation policies such as diffusion- and flow-based VLAs can be augmented, rather than retrained, to improve robustness during physical interaction.

* **Tactile-guided residual reinforcement learning**
  Developing small, bounded RL correction modules that leverage tactile and proprioceptive feedback to compensate for misalignment, slip, and jamming during contact, while keeping high-level VLA policies unchanged.

* **Embodied and closed-loop learning**
  Focusing on learning mechanisms that exploit physical interaction, instead of relying solely on offline imitation, to achieve safer and more transferable robot behavior.

* **Neuromorphic and efficient sensing-action pipelines**
  Exploring spiking and event-based approaches for low-latency, energy-efficient feedback in active exploration and manipulation.

This direction is inspired by my PhD proposal on *Adaptive Vision-Language-Action Models through Tactile-Guided Residual Reinforcement Learning for Contact-Rich Manipulation*.
